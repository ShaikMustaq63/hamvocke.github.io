	<h1>Hi, I'm Ham!<a href="#ham">*</a></h1>

	<div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/ham.jpg" alt="Ham Vocke" class="img-circle float-right"></div>

	<p>I'm a Software Developer and Consultant living in Hamburg and working at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>.</p>

	<p>I love building software and managed to turn that into my profession. At ThoughtWorks I help teams deliver software and get people excited about trying new things and making the most out of their day.</p>

	<p>Over the last years I've worked on quite a few software projects for renowned companies and got to work with a bunch of different technologies. And as everyone loves buzzwords here's some of the languages, tools, technologies and methodologies I've used and worked with in the past:</p>
