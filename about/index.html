	<p>I've got a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Systems (<i>Wirtschaftsinformatik</i>) from the University of Applied Sciences Paderborn (<i>FHDW Paderborn</i>) and a Master's degree in Information Management from the WWU Münster. During that time I worked as a Software Developer at Bertelsmann in Gütersloh. There I had the opportunity to work with smart people on challenging projects. Together we delivered software with high value for external customers.</p>
