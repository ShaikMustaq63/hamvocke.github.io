excerpt: More than three months into my new job at ThoughtWorks I take a first look in the rearview mirror and reflect about work, company culture and other remarkable stuff
---

More than three months ago I took the first step of a fascinating journey: It was my first day at 
[ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) in Hamburg. The prospect of a new job in a new city
had made me curious and nervous for the past couple of weeks. As it turned out, the anxiety should
only last until my very first hours at work. After that everything immediately felt like home.

# Breakfast and Handshakes
My first day at ThoughtWorks started after a night of fairly restless sleep. I woke up way too early
that Monday morning and everything felt unfamiliar. A different apartment to
wake up in, an unknown way to work, being a complete stranger in a big city. _"This will take ages to
get used to"_, was the thought that constantly accompanied me.

I took the _S31_ and the _U3_ lines to the office that morning which worked way better that I
expected, given that I am a total public transport dilettante. So there I was, outside of the new
office, way ahead of my time and hesitant to enter. I grabbed a coffee from a shop at the corner and
decided to wait outside since I did not want to be the first on the scene.

When I finally entered the office I was greeted by a sweet breakfast with Franzbr√∂tchen, Croissants 
and more people than I could ever remember in such a short time. Everyone was keen to introduce themselves 
and curious to hear who I was and what I had to tell. `anxiety--;`


# Polyglot projects and the best tools for the job
Right during our breakfast I was told which project I'd be assigned to. I only got the project's name
so I was eager to get to know more about what would keep me occupied for the next months. After
a short time of fiddling around with my new notebook I had a session in which I was introduced to
the project, the business model and the technologies we chose to work with. Hearing about the technology
stack and realizing how polyglot this project would be put a big grin on my face. It was obvious
that these people really love technology. Leveraging the latest and greatest languages,
frameworks and tools available is the way to go for the company and I was more than happy to be
part of that. It is a great feeling to know that I could use many of the technologies I would fiddle
around with in my spare time anyways.

I was used to work with self-written Java frameworks that were thought to be a one-size-fits-all
solution to each and every project presented to us. There's nothing wrong with using Java, not at
all. However, I never liked the approach of shoehorning every single requirement into something that could be solved
with the few given tools had at hand instead of using the best tools for the job. Seeing that my
team would share that opinion and was eager to try something new was obviously something I was
absolutely happy with. Working on a project and getting the chance to learn new languages and
frameworks at the same time was obviously something I was more than pleased to do. `happiness++;`


# Trains on strike, a pub, and an expensive taxi
My first day ended quite spectacular. The train drivers were on strike so I had no way to get home
to my apartment after work. A colleague suggested to join him for one beer at the pub and so things
took its course. After a little more than the announced _"one beer"_ I ended up being stranded somewhere 
in Hamburg (thanks to the public transport dilettante that I am) with a dead phone and this random guy 
from Leeds and whom I called "Dave" even though that was certainly not his real name. Dave and I
managed to share a Taxi to the central station and I took the Taxi to get further home to my apartment.
After all it was a great -- albeit expensive, thanks to the Taxi -- night and a great ending of my
first day. The spontaneous pub night helped breaking the ice and from that point onwards the
unfamiliarity was gone. And I had a decent story to share on the next day.


# ThoughtWorks, what's it like?
It's only been a little more than three months and I am far away from having seen it all. But I
think I have seen enough for a first roundup. So here are a couple of things that I consider to be
the most remarkable for working with ThoughtWorks:

## TDD, all the way
One thing I really got to appreciate is the clear focus on [Test-driven
development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD). Of course I was familiar with
writing automated tests of all kinds before. I read Kent Beck's _TDD by Example_ and was aware of the benefits 
you get from test automation. I thought I knew what TDD meant until I got to work
with the people at TW. 

Seeing the focus on TDD and how it helped shaping the software we
created made clear that my previous understanding of TDD could at best be described with a
'test-first' approach. Sure, it worked and I produced results. I delivered software at my previous
job as well, after all. However, it was far from what I encountered at TW and it didn't take long to really
convince me of the benefits of having a pretty strict focus on Test-driven development.

## Pair Programming
The one thing that was completely new to me was the practice of Pair Programming. The entire
development at TW is done in pairs. I have to admit that I had to get used to that in the first
days. My fellow Devs made it very easy to get used to it, though, and turned out to be very
supportive.

Pair Programming was the one thing I couldn't decide on whether it made sense for me or not. 
I knew it would be practised at TW in advance so it came as no surprise. I just
couldn't imagine that having two people working on the same task all the time would really be
worth the investment. It turns out that all my skepticism was unjustified. Working with a Pair
turned out to be great, especially for new team members: 

1.  You get up and running very fast. Your pair can introduce you to the tools and techniques you
  might not know yet.
2.  The bad conscience sits right next to you. No more _"that's good enough"_ solutions, no more _"I 
will fix that later"_. Everyone gets tempted to deliver a quick and dirty hack instead of cleaning
up. We all know better but tend to ignore that. Good luck trying to ignore your pair!
3.  There's always something interesting to learn. You always take away that one fancy shortcut you
can't believe you didn't know or that new plugin for your favorite editor. You will be surprised
how much of those little tricks you can gather in a short time.
4.  "Hitting the wall": Your pair can help you. Everyone gets stuck from time to time. This is what
we get from working with not completely understood technology and domains. Working with a pair
will help you with that.
5. Spread the knowledge. You reduce the [Bus Factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) if at
least two people know about each topic and therefore reduce the risk for the entire project.
