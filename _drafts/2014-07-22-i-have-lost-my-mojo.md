The last few months have been pure idle time for me. After finishing my Master's thesis I suddenly found myself in a situation where -- for the first time in about six years -- didn't *have to* do anything after work. No university assignments, no studying for exams, no theses, nothing. In the last weeks of writing my Master's thesis I was really looking forward to this time where I could simply come to my appartment after work and enjoy the beautiful idle time. I would finally be able to dust off my old XBox, play some video games that I've always wanted to play but kept putting aside since I had other things to do. More importantly I would finally be able to hack around on my Raspberry Pi and do all the great stuff that's been buzzing in my mind. And I would finally have the time to work on all these ideas for side projects that I have quickly sketched in a couple of minutes during breakfast the last months and years. Oh boy, how wrong I was...

In the abscence of deadlines and without the need to finish something, I quickly found myself wasting hours after hours surfing the web, watching TV or playing video games. I didn't do anything productive. Side projects? Yeah, sure... later. Setting up my Raspberry Pi powered home server? Well, it is silently sitting connected to my router, with a basic Raspbian installation and connected to the internet via dyndns but that's about it. Heck, I even lost the motivation to work out regularly.

What the f*ck had happend?

Lost my momentum, got stuck doing nothing. Leisure time is allowed but has the risk of getting stuck in a state of being motionless. I want to explore, improve.
How do I change that? Do something productive everyday. One tiny bugfix which fixes a typo in a logging statement, one little new feature, one refactoring. Anything. Paired with more excercise. Maybe my "longest streak" stat on GitHub will profit.
