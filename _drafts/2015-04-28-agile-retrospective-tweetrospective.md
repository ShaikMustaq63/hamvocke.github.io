title: "Agile Retrospective Idea: The Tweetrospective"
tags: agile 
excerpt: I've recently tried a new approach for facilitating an agile retrospecitve based on Twitter. It was a fun and creative session and I got great feedback. Read what I've done, what I've learned and grab some resources to do it yourself!

Retrospectives are an essential tool in Agile software development. Whatever methodology you use,
as long as you develop software in iterations you will have retrospectives after each of those.
Retrospectives help the team to take a step back from the day-to-day business and to reflect on
what's happened in the past iteration. The team gets to discuss about problems and risks, annoyances
and moments of frustration, but also about successes and progress. All of this has the intention to
find a way to eliminate the bad things and to make the good stuff even better in the future.

Every Retrospective will be facilitated by one person (the facilitator) who will prepare and setup 
the retro and guide the team. There are different approaches on how to facilitate a good retro and
there are more books than you will want to read about that specific topic so I won't go into detail
here [^1]. 

In our team at ThoughtWorks we take turns on who will facilitate the next retrospectives. This week I
volunteered to facilitate the retro for our team and so it was my turn to prepare the session. I have 
facilitated a couple of retrospectives since I've joined ThoughtWorks. My previous approaches to gather 
data for the team to discuss about usually revolved around the classic questions of _"what was good?"_, 
_"whatwas bad?"_, and _"what puzzles me?"_ or some slight variation of these. 
This is a very easy and proven concept. The team is familiar with it and it gets the job done. On the
other hand the terms "proven" and "familiar" indicate that it tends to be pretty boring for the team. And
boredom is nothing you'd want if you want to push the team to get creative and open before starting
a discussion. 

In order to make the next retro more interesting again and to get the creativity flowing, I wanted 
to try something new instead of following the well-known and easy path. But where to start? I am far 
from being an experienced facilitator. I've read [The Retrospective
Handbook](https://leanpub.com/the-retrospective-handbook) by [Pat
Kua](https://www.thekua.com/atwork/) (which I can totally recommend, it's a quick and enjoyable read 
and really helps you keeping everything in mind for preparing retrospectives) and facilitated a handful 
of retros that got the job done but that's about it. There's no vast pool of experience that I could
rely on.

Luckily enough there's a nice place for inspiration online that a colleague of mine showed me a
couple of weeks ago: the [Retr-o-mat](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com/) has a very nice
collection of ideas and approaches for the individual phases for a retrospective. And on top of it
it will automatically generate a fully fledged plan for your next retro by randomly picking one of the concepts
for five typical steps in a retro's agenda.

Introducing five new concepts for our team in the upcoming retro was more than I wanted to do. For
once we only have limited time and I want to get the most out of it instead of spending most of it
explaining new games and approaches to the team. Secondly we are not that strict when it comes to
the agenda of a retro. So instead of picking a completely generated plan I started browsing through
the individual suggestions for the _"Gather Data"_ and _"Generate Insights"_ sections. There were
quite some interesting suggestions around here and I can highly recommend browsing through them from
time to time.

Eventually I stumbled across the ["#tweetmysprint"](http://plans-for-retrospectives.com/?id=97) idea
by [Thomas Guest](http://wordaligned.org/) and found it to be really interesting. It suggests using
Twitter's tweet format to let the team write their thoughts about the past iteration and ordering it
in a timeline. I decided to let my retro revolve around exactly this concept. As it turns out it was
a great idea. Our team had lots of fun and we got some really interesting results out of it. 

At the end of this post you will find some resources that will help you doing it yourself

## The concept in a nutshell
You start off describing the concept to the team. The team gets to write a couple of tweets about
the last iteration on sticky notes. _#hashtags_, _@mentions_ and _emojis_ are highly encouraged. 
Next you organize all these tweets into a timeline and
read it out loud. Every teammember gets to vote on the tweets he or she wants to discuss about using
_retweets_ and _favourites_. You organize the highest voted tweets into _trending topics_ and give
the team time to discuss about these in more detail.

It turns out that the Twitter universe offers everything you need for this. Restricting the opinions
on the sticky notes to Twitter's 140 characters limit is a good lesson on brevity and conciseness.
It is challenging to stick to this format and therefore will result in some really creative answers. 
Hashtags, Mentions and Emojis really offer some unique opportunities. Mentioning someone in a tweet
can be used to appreciate a specific person or to celebrate success. Hashtags are a really great
concept to put additional information, emotion or funny references into the short tweet format.


## Preparation
As usual make sure to have a room where the whole team can sit and be undisturbed. Get enough sticky
notes and pens for everyone. Make sure to pick the right format for the sticky notes. I've found a
wide rectangular shape to be fitting (obviously resembling the format of one single tweet).

Print enough of the resources sheets at the end of this post **(TODO ADD LINK)** for your team and
cut out the retweet and favourite icons. Prepare a bunch of these "icons" for each team member and
hand them out together with the sticky notes and pen.

For a handy preparation checklist take another look into Pat Kua's Retrospective Handbook.

## Facilitating the Retro
Start as usual, prime directive, safety check, whatever you do.
Explain the concept to the team and encourage them to really follow the Twitter approach.

### Presenting the Concept
Explain how Twitter works. Most people will know anyway, so this should not be too hard. Explain
what type of content gets publishes on Twitter. Explain the
140 characters limit of tweets, hashtags, mentioning other users and emojis. Explain that the team gets 
10 minutes to write as many tweets as they like. 

What worked well for me was that I had prepared an example tweet on a sticky note that included
hashtags, mentions and emojis to show off what was possible. The content of this example tweet was just 
a reference to one of our team's inside jokes which really helped laid out the foundation for a lighthearted
atmosphere.

### Writing Tweets
include your name if. if you don't want to, write "anonymous".
write rants, appreciations, success stories, shameless plugs, failures, etc.
### Organising the Timeline

### Retweets & Favourites

## Possible enhancements
