## Customizations, a very basic config
- change modifier key binding (C-a)
- caps lock -> ctrl
- split windows vertically, horizontally
- get started from here, add your own modifications by research


In my [previous blog post](/2015/08/04/increase-your-productivity-with-tmux.html) I gave a brief introduction on tmux and how it can help boost your productivity when using the terminal. This post presents a tmux.conf that includes some modifications that make tmux look and behave a little nicer, especially when it comes down to pairing. I'll explain the individual modifications as good as I can so that you can pick up what you find usable and use it in your own tmux.conf as you like.
